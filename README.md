# ODFMA-System-Analysis
An OFDMA system with two user downlinks 
- This project successfully simulates an OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) system.
- This also incorporates a system which transmits two OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) symbols to two users simultaneously with an added feature of channel estimation.
